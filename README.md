 ## Description

 A README file is a text file (commonly readme.txt) containing information for the user about the software program, utility, or game. README files often contain instructions and additional help, and details about patches or updates. This application will help you to make a good README file automatically. You just have to answer the prompted questions on your terminal and your file will be generated.
